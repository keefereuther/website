description: Hi all! I'm Keefe Reuther, a member of the School of Biological Sciences teaching faculty at UC San Diego. <br><br> While my background is in behavioral ecology (primarily in fishes and ants!), I transitioned in 2009 to focus on my core passion - teaching. <br><br> As a lecturer of general biology courses, I saw a need to prioritize undergraduate training in practical science skills. Without development of these hard-earned skills, it is increasingly difficult to understand, evaluate, and create biological information. This is potentially catastrophic in a era of rampant disinformation. The health of our society quite literally depends on ambassadors of good science.  <br><br> In 2020 I became an Assistant Teaching Professor with the goal of creating learning tools at the intersection of biology, statistics, experimental design, and data science.
